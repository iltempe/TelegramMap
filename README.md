In localhost is possible to launch
php start.php 'sethook' to set start.php as webhook
php start.php 'removehook' to remove start.php as webhook
php start.php 'getupdates' to run getupdates.php

After setup webhook is possible to use telegram managed by webhost


To use the system
- make a Telegram Bot
- Send Location to it
- Reply to bot with a text description
- All data are sent in the database and than convert in CSV format
- Data can mapped now

A simple example is implemented here http://iltempe.github.io/Emergenzeprato/
